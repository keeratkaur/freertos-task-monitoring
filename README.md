# FreeRTOS Task Monitoring & Stack Usage Analyzer

A real-time system monitoring tool that analyzes task behavior, stack usage, and detects potential stack overflow conditions in FreeRTOS-based applications.

## 🎯 What This Project Demonstrates

This project showcases **systems-level thinking** by implementing:

- **Real-time task monitoring** using FreeRTOS introspection APIs
- **Stack usage analysis** to identify memory safety risks
- **Stack overflow detection** through proactive monitoring
- **Task state tracking** to understand RTOS scheduling behavior
- **Priority stress testing** to demonstrate scheduling behavior under CPU pressure

## 🧠 Why This Matters

In embedded systems and real-time operating systems, understanding task behavior is critical for:

- **Memory Safety**: Stack overflows can cause unpredictable system crashes
- **System Reliability**: Monitoring task states helps identify deadlocks and priority inversions
- **Resource Management**: Stack high-water marks reveal memory efficiency
- **Debugging**: Runtime statistics provide insights into system behavior

This directly maps to **OS/RTOS internals** and demonstrates understanding of:
- Task scheduling and preemption
- Priority inversion awareness and scheduling pressure analysis
- Stack vs heap memory management
- System introspection and observability
- Safety-first design principles

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application creates multiple worker tasks with different stack sizes and work patterns, including a high-priority stress test task that creates CPU pressure through busy loops. A dedicated monitoring task periodically analyzes:

1. **Task States**: Running, Ready, Blocked, Suspended
2. **Stack High-Water Marks**: Remaining stack space for each task
3. **Task Priorities**: Current priority levels
4. **Runtime Statistics**: Total system runtime
5. **Scheduling Behavior**: How tasks behave under priority pressure

The monitor identifies tasks with low stack remaining and flags them as warnings or critical risks. The high-priority task demonstrates scheduling behavior under CPU pressure, showing how the RTOS scheduler handles priority-based preemption.

## 📋 Features

- ✅ Real-time task state monitoring
- ✅ Stack usage tracking with high-water mark analysis
- ✅ Stack overflow risk detection (warnings for <200 bytes, critical for <100 bytes)
- ✅ Runtime statistics collection
- ✅ Multiple task demonstration with varying stack sizes
- ✅ Stack overflow hook implementation
- ✅ **Priority stress test** - High-priority task with busy loops demonstrates scheduling behavior under CPU pressure

## 🔧 Configuration

Key FreeRTOS configuration options enabled in `FreeRTOSConfig.h`:

```c
#define configUSE_TRACE_FACILITY                1
#define configUSE_STATS_FORMATTING_FUNCTIONS    1
#define configCHECK_FOR_STACK_OVERFLOW          2
#define configGENERATE_RUN_TIME_STATS           1
```

## 🚀 Building and Running

### Prerequisites

- GCC compiler

```

### Using FreeRTOS POSIX Simulator

For the simplest setup, use the [FreeRTOS POSIX Simulator](https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS/tree/main/FreeRTOS/Demo/Posix_GCC):

1. Clone FreeRTOS repository
2. Copy this project's `main.c` to the POSIX demo directory
3. Update `FreeRTOSConfig.h` as needed
4. Build using the provided Makefile

## 🔍 Key Implementation Details

### Stack Monitoring

The monitoring task uses `uxTaskGetSystemState()` to retrieve:
- Task status structures for all tasks
- Stack high-water marks (minimum remaining stack)
- Current task states
- Priority information

### Stack Overflow Detection

FreeRTOS is configured with `configCHECK_FOR_STACK_OVERFLOW 2`, which:
- Uses a pattern-based detection method
- Calls `vApplicationStackOverflowHook()` on overflow
- Provides task handle and name for debugging

### Memory Safety

The monitor allocates memory for task status arrays using `pvPortMalloc()`, demonstrating proper heap usage in an RTOS environment.

### Priority Stress Testing

A high-priority task (`HighPriorityTask`) runs busy loops with minimal delays, creating CPU pressure and demonstrating:

- **Priority-based scheduling**: Higher priority tasks preempt lower priority ones
- **Scheduling pressure analysis**: How the system behaves under CPU load
- **Priority inversion awareness**: Understanding when lower-priority tasks may be starved

This is particularly relevant for **Apple interview discussions** about OS scheduling, as it demonstrates practical understanding of:
- Task preemption behavior
- CPU utilization under priority pressure
- Real-time scheduling guarantees

The monitoring task shows how lower-priority tasks (WorkerTask1, WorkerTask2) spend more time in "Ready" state when the high-priority task is active, while the high-priority task dominates "Running" state.

## 📝 Technical Highlights

- **RTOS Internals**: Direct use of FreeRTOS kernel APIs for system introspection
- **Memory Management**: Stack vs heap awareness, proper allocation patterns
- **Safety Engineering**: Proactive overflow detection and risk assessment
- **System Observability**: Real-time monitoring without external debuggers

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates understanding of:

1. **Task Scheduling**: How RTOS manages multiple concurrent tasks
2. **Stack Management**: Why stack monitoring is critical in embedded systems
3. **System Introspection**: Using OS APIs to analyze runtime behavior
4. **Safety Patterns**: Detecting and preventing memory-related failures
